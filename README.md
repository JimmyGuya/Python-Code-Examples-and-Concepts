# Python Code Examples and Concepts

Description
This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various programming concepts and tasks. The following are covered:

1. Palindrome Check using Stack:

A Python script that determines whether a string is a palindrome by using the stack data structure, adhering to the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

2. List Comprehension:

Examples of list comprehensions in Python, showcasing concise methods for generating lists, filtering data, and transforming elements.

3. Compound Data Types:

Demonstrations of compound data types such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries, highlighting their usage in Python.

4. Bigram Extraction:

A function that takes a string as input and returns a list of bigrams (pairs of consecutive characters) from the string.

5. Closest Key in a Dictionary:

A function designed to find the closest key in a dictionary based on the position of a value within a list of values associated with each key.

Each script is self-contained and illustrates fundamental Python programming techniques that can be applied to a variety of tasks. Explore the individual files for code and detailed comments.
